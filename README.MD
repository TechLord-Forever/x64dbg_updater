Since there was no Python code out there that could get latest github Releases, i made this little tool-
that can fetch latest build via github JSON.

Only found Curl code that could do this!

this fetch both x64dbg latest release , and x64dbgpy latest release.

Only use 60 times per day or github will block your ip for 24 hours. :P

add your own release repo api.

**Howto**

Build with plugin template [https://github.com/techbliss/x64dbgpy-Plugin-Template]() 

or run as script.

Works outside x64dbg also.
